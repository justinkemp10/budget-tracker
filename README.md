# Budget Tracker Application

## The Task

To add functionality to an existing budget tracker application to allow for offline access and functionality.

## User Story

AS AN avid traveler, I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection, SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a user is on Budget App without an internet connection, WHEN the user inputs a withdrawal or deposit, THEN that will be shown on the page, and added to their transaction history when their connection is back online.
